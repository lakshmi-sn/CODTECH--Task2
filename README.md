overview of the task student grade tracker using python programming
1. Objective
The goal is to develop a Python-based system that:

Records and organizes student information (e.g., name, ID, subjects, and grades).
Calculates useful metrics such as averages, total scores, or grade classifications.
Provides data visualization for performance trends.
Generates reports for individual students or a group.
2. Key Features
Input Management:

Add, update, or delete student records.
Validate inputs to avoid errors (e.g., grades within the valid range).
Grade Computation:

Calculate subject-wise and overall averages.
Assign letter grades or GPA based on scoring criteria.
Data Retrieval:

Search for students by name or ID.
Retrieve grades for specific subjects or terms.
Visualization (optional):

Display bar charts or pie charts for grade distribution using libraries like matplotlib.
Reporting:

Generate detailed reports summarizing a studentâ€™s performance.
3. Tools and Libraries
Core Python:
Dictionaries or lists to store student data.
File Handling:
Use CSV or JSON for persistent storage.
Optional Libraries:
pandas for data manipulation.
matplotlib or seaborn for visualizations.
numpy for advanced calculations.
